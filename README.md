STAR is a local-first desktop assistant for Windows. It listens for `hello star`, understands Hinglish, Hindi-style commands, and English, speaks back with Edge TTS, controls the laptop, remembers useful context, runs productivity workflows, and can extend to Android through a secure Termux phone bridge.

The project is built like a personal operating layer: a FastAPI brain, a wake-word listener, a web dashboard, persistent SQLite memory, local automation tools, optional Groq intelligence, and a mobile companion that lets the phone participate without turning the laptop server off.

## Experience

STAR is meant to feel like a practical assistant sitting on your machine, not a demo script. You can say `hello star open chrome`, ask for your agenda, close apps in Hinglish, run WhatsApp helpers, queue phone actions, or put STAR into sleep/quiet mode without killing the backend.

| Voice runtime | Wake phrase, continuous listening, stop/repeat/sleep/quiet/resume controls |
| Web dashboard | Chat, memory, tasks, voice settings, integrations, analytics, logs, phone pairing |
| Mobile web | Phone browser command mode with phone-side spoken replies |
| Android bridge | Termux worker for phone actions like vibrate, speak, torch, volume, media, clipboard, location |
| Local brain | SQLite memory, conversation history, logs, command history, suggestions, confirmations |

## Quick Start

### 1. Create the environment

```powershell
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure optional secrets

Create `.env` in the project root.

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email_address
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password
```

`PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY` is optional. Without it, STAR uses the free keyless speech wake mode.

### 3. Start STAR

```powershell
.\scripts\start_star.ps1
```

The script starts the backend and wake listener in the background. It is duplicate-safe, so running it again will not create extra backend copies.

### 4. Open the dashboard

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard
```

Runtime helpers:

```powershell
.\scripts\status_star.ps1
.\scripts\stop_star.ps1
.\scripts\install_startup.ps1
.\scripts\uninstall_startup.ps1
```

After `install_startup.ps1`, STAR starts automatically when the Windows user logs in. It keeps running until the laptop shuts down, restarts, or you manually stop it.

## Voice Behavior

| Say this | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `hello star` | Wake STAR and start command mode |
| `talk in english` / `english me baat kar` | Force English replies and English TTS profile |
| `talk in hindi` / `hindi me baat kar` | Force Hindi replies and Hindi TTS profile |
| `talk in hinglish` / `hinglish me baat kar` | Force Hinglish replies and Indian English TTS profile |
| `stop` | Stop current speech only, server stays on |
| `repeat` or `dobara bolo` | Repeat last response |
| `star u can sleep` / `star sleep` / `star so ja` | Exit command mode and keep wake listening alive |
| `hello star` after sleep | Start listening again |
| `star abhi chup` / `star band ho ja` | Quiet mode; normal conversation is ignored |
| `ok star you can talk` / `chal star tu ab baat kar sakta hai` | Resume replies from quiet mode |
| `stop server` / `close backend` | Blocked from voice so the server does not get killed accidentally |

## Mobile Companion

STAR has two mobile layers.

| Layer | Best for | URL / setup |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile web | Phone browser voice commands and phone-side replies | `http://YOUR-LAPTOP-IP:8000/mobile` |
| Android Termux bridge | Phone system actions that browsers cannot perform | `mobile_bridge/README.md` |

Run this to see the current phone-ready URL:

```powershell
.\scripts\status_star.ps1
```

Open the mobile URL on a phone connected to the same Wi-Fi. Tap `Start Wake`, allow microphone access, then say `hello star`.

For secure Android bridge pairing, open the dashboard, go to `Integrations`, find `Phone Bridge`, click `Rotate Secret`, copy the generated Termux commands, and paste them into Termux.

Phone bridge examples:

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `phone find` | Makes the phone announce/vibrate so you can find it |
| `phone speak hello bhai` | Speaks on the phone |
| `phone vibrate` | Vibrates the phone |
| `phone notify STAR message Check your tasks` | Shows a phone notification |
| `phone torch on` / `phone torch off` | Controls flashlight |
| `phone volume 10` / `phone volume max` | Changes media volume |
| `phone brightness 180` / `phone brightness auto` | Changes brightness |
| `phone media play pause` / `phone media next` | Sends media key events |
| `phone clipboard set hello` / `phone clipboard read` | Writes or reads phone clipboard |
| `phone location` / `phone wifi` / `phone device info` | Queues device information actions |

Android security still applies. Call and SMS commands open Android intents; they do not silently place calls or send messages.

```

## Safety Model

STAR is intentionally local-first. The backend runs on your laptop, memory stays in SQLite, and high-risk actions use confirmation gates. Voice commands cannot stop the backend. Mobile pairing can use a shared secret, and the dashboard can rotate that secret.

Some integrations still depend on external accounts or services:

| Feature | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| Groq intelligence | `GROQ_API_KEY` |
| Email | Email address and app password |
| Picovoice wake word | Optional `PICOVOICE_ACCESS_KEY` |
| Smart home | Home Assistant URL and token |
| Android bridge | Termux and Termux:API installed on the phone |

## Notes

The Android bridge gives useful phone control, but it does not bypass Android permission rules. For deeper phone automation, the next step is a native Android companion with an Accessibility service and explicit user-granted permissions.

Cloud sync currently writes local snapshots to `CLOUD_SYNC_DIR` or `cloud_sync/`. Full Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox sync can be added on top of the same integration layer.
